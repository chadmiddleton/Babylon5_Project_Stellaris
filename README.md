The Babylon 5 Project: A Stellaris Mod


Welcome to the Babylon5 Project! 

This is the production release of the mod. This can and should be downloaded from the Steam Workshop, but for those of you who want a manual install, or an easy look at the production code, help yourself! If you are looking to assist with the project, feel free to fork the Dev1 repository and send pull requests there. There's no guarantee that the Dev1 branch is stable at all. This one should be.
